/**
 * Require.js needs to know a few things before we can begin.
 * Here is an example of the 3 basic things needed to configure
 * the application: a configuration file, the base URL, and the
 * application package.
 *
 * Define the config file as a value of the app.prototype. The
 * path to your config file should be relative to the site
 * root and contain the full file name. At this point, require
 * has not yet been bootstrapped so it won't add the file
 * extension.
 *
 * Define a base URL, even if it is root. The base URL should
 * always be the path to the folder containing the app package.
 *
 * Define the app package, and any other needed packages.
 * Require assumes the package is in the base URL folder, and
 * has its own main.js. If the server does not follow these
 * standards, you can specify alternate configurations.
 * See http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#packages for more.
